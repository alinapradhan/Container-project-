This Docker project sets up a lightweight environment with Git and Bash, useful for scripting or development in a containerized environment.




We're creating a Docker container that gives us a basic development environment with:

Git – so you can use version control.
Bash – a Linux command-line shell that’s great for scripting and terminal use.
Other optional tools: curl, nano, etc.

This is especially handy if:
You're on Windows and want a consistent Unix-like shell (like Git Bash).
You want a portable dev setup you can spin up anywhere with Docker.
